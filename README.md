This is the code for my bachelor's thesis titled 'The Impact of the Leverage Effect in GARCH Models in Risk Management'.

The repository contains all the code I have written.

The different simulations I have conducted can be found in the 'Simulations' folder. Each simulation is coded in a separate file. The initialization of the Monte Carlo simulation study is performed in the 'MonteCarlo_Results' file. It specifies the number of simulations, sources every simulation file, and creates a dataframe with the final results.

In the 'Plots and Illustrations' folder, you can find the code for all the graphics presented in my thesis.
